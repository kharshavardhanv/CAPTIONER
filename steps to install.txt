-connect kaggle to colab using operations done in colab
-import modules
-set up base & working directory
-load vgg16 model
-extract features from image
-store it in features.pkl file
-to resuse it agin; when u are again using colab just load pickle file instead of feature extraction agin




Load trained model:

#iterate through this while loading saved model else go through above process

from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model=load_model("best_model.h5")
